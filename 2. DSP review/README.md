## Basic concept of the physics of sound
I referenced most of information from [this paper](https://jkslp.org/upload/pdf/jkslp-22-2-99.pdf). If you are korean, it's very helpful to understand about what sound is, what is dB scale, what is unit of amplitude, etc.

### Definition of sound
If the sound is explained in view of physics, phenomenon that transfering pressure wave from sound source through the medium. In this situation, sound make sound wave.  

Medium has a property to return as possible to their places when they are moved by pressure or something. In this process, they also transfer a specific action at some point to other point. Pressure wave occurs when particles in medium vibrate, and this vibration cause a different density of spaces, it's called a compression and rarefraction.  

Speed at which sound is transmitted depends on the type and nature of the medium. Sound which we can hear also depends on temperature, barometric pressure, humidity on atmosphere. Therefore, at average barometric pressure and 15 degree celsius, velocity of sound is about 340.45 m/s.

### Sound wave
At seen above, sound makes wave called sound wave. Each sound wave have a their own different shape and these are largely divided into two gategories, simple, sinwave and complex wave. 

Simplest wave has a sinusoidal from like a monotone. Complex wave is divided into two part again, periodic wave and aperiodic wave. To understand exactly what the differences are, we need to know about frequency, wavefrom, amplitude and phase.
