## Fourier Transform
Fourier transform changes a view for signals. We are familier with seeing x-axis as continuous time. The normal graph changes by fourier transform to have x-axis as frequency. These concept is applied to not only continuous time domain, but also to discrete time domain and just discrete slots. These are named to `CTFT (Continuous-Time Fourier Transform)`, `DTFT (Discrete-Time Fourier Transform)`, `DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform)`. More details about systems equation analysis are in Signal ans System lectures. 
  
## CTFT and DTFT
In signals and system, you've learned about correlation as follows:
